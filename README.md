# Information Design Ideas for TouchDesigner
I am trying to utilize TouchDesigner for information design and interactive 
data representation. This repository is a collection of ideas on how to 
parse and interpret different (external) data sources.

## Flora
Visualize the amount of certain plant elements. 
1. **Flora_Ex1:** Slider based interaction with discrete data from a table DAT. 
2. **Flora_Ex2:** Slider based interaction with discrete data. Read and parse data from a CSV file. 
3. **Flora_Ex2:** Read and parse data from a JSON file with Python.
